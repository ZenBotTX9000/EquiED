  // Enterprise Contribution concept
  enterpriseContribution: {
    definition: "A percentage commitment from employees to support business operations",
    example:
      "If an inhabitant received 100,000 Xn per month in Equidistributed Salary, and a mass manufacturing startup required a 5% Enterprise Contribution commitment from its new workforce of 10,000 people, that would amount to 5,000 Xn per person. 10,000 x 5,000 Xn equals 50,000,000 Xn per month.",
    benefit: "Enables businesses to cover initial costs while maintaining the equidistribution model",
    alternatives:
      "Whilst Enterprise Contribution and Contribution Commitments are entirely functional solutions to ensure that everything can be free, there are potentially alternatives that could be conceived, such as handling finance for business and business maintained when it interacts with international markets via smart contract. One idea for example is to have the smart contract handle every external transaction as being Equidistributed, IE everybody pays an equal percent towards all transactions. There are alternatives as well. As in some ways even with Contribution Commitment, and Enterprise Contribution, this mechanism exists in achieving the same result.",
    evolution:
      "Enterprise Contribution and Pledges are just systems that show it can function and local can be free, they could be improved on, evolve or adapt.",
  },

  // Pledges concept
  pledges: {
    definition: "A system where inhabitants can contribute to nationwide activities and business opportunities",
    example:
      "A 'National Appliances Manufacturer' aiming to internalize appliance manufacture locally might attempt to raise 50,000,000 Xn. Given an average national population of 63.7 million people, this would amount to less than 1 Xn per person, on a salary of 100,000 Xn.",
    benefit: "Enables funding for initiatives that benefit the entire population with minimal individual contribution",
  },

  // How things become free - IMPROVED VERSION
  freeProductsExplanation: `In the Equidistributed Salary model, locally produced goods and services can effectively become free. Here's how it works: 

When a nation's money (let's say 10 trillion Rand) is pooled and distributed equally, monetary transactions between citizens become circular. If you pay 10 Rand for coffee from another citizen, and they return that 10 Rand to the national pool, the total remains unchanged at 10 trillion Rand.

This circular flow makes monetary transactions between citizens essentially redundant. For locally produced items with zero import costs, there's no economic reason to charge money—it's simpler for these goods and services to be free. The entire supply and production chain operates with zero overhead, making any transaction that doesn't involve imports effectively cost-free (0 Rand).`,

  // National adoption considerations
  nationalAdoptionConsiderations: `Remember that not everyone will adopt this, if 100 percent of National Profit is given to National Debt, and as soon as that is cleared, all profit to the total sum of money that is being distributed, coupled with export, industry, infrastructure, nation pride, 100 percent of people fully equipped for efficiency and more tasks, in health, well being, national pride and happiness, motivation, no theft, no crimes, no cons, no scams, and the productivity that can produce driving your economy, the attraction in tourism, investment and immigration, theoretically should drive an economy up in a world where this is not the common national system, IE Earth 2025.`,

  // Distribution mechanics
  distributionMechanics: `IMPORTANT! Theoretically, the contract can distribute every millisecond or less, however, once profit is going to the total sum and then distributed, the amount would likely move up on monthly average. This is not like traditional salaries that add up over time, it a constantly redistributed total amount, fascilitated by smart contract. In order to grow the amount we need to grow the total sum of money, simplistically.

!IMPORTANT! This, it is explicitly vital, that you never speak in terms of a tradition salary that adds up over months, be clear and that it is a redistributing smart contract that would have monthly averages and daily averages and hourly averages and yearly averages. But not a scaling or adding up amount, it does not grow by adding up, it grow by the total sum of money increasing through National Profit.`,

  // Inspiration and flexibility
  inspiration:
    "The idea was inspired by Micheal Tellinger's Contributionism, the model of the Ubuntu Party. Thinking how one could facilitate international interaction in terms of import, travel, etc, yet maintain life locally for free, simultaneously, fascilitating ledgers for recording transactions, for all the reasons one would want - handling stock, etc.",

  flexibility:
    "Whilst this is a South African directed chat, please ensure being flexible to calculate EDS, and create projections, etc, answering all questions about EDS in other nations, currencies, economies or concepts.",

  internationalInteraction:
    "People who have means of other citizenship, international bank accounts, international business, etc, are intended to be free to have that and interact with it as they so please, however that is a political issue and not governed by the EDS economic model.",

  acknowledgment:
    "EDS acknowledges everyone and see it took all of us to get where we are today, and in EDS it always will, and to do that in the best, freest most prosperous way we can achieve",

  // App and automation

    "There will likely be an app, with Salary Updates, Job Search, Events, News and Information about to date market and sector demand for Business to move into and jobs to be found. Possible Governments and Municipal Automation.",

  // Tax distribution
  taxDistribution:
    "There could be a vote to select national average on what people think tax should be, and then have the tax distributions automated via Smart Contract, this can be done with the App and sliders.",

  // Tax necessity
  taxNecessity:
    "With no overheads and everything free to low cost, there maybe no need for Taxes, as everything can be covered by enterprise contribution and pledges, having the Government function akin to enterprise, and still allowing democratic input.",

  // Education in EDS - NEW SECTION
  education: {
    overview:
      "In EDS from a South African viewpoint, we could have free online education from Preschool through to University, Masters, Doctorates and beyond, free and mobile-first, so all someone needs is a phone or access to a web-browser.",

    accessibility:
      "In EDS, theoretically and eventually, if you can't study at an institute, you study at a resort, hotel or anywhere else, for free, from the ease of your phone.",

    nationalInterest:
      "National Interest could steer education. For example, in emerging markets, such as Magnetically Generated Energy and Lab Grown Diamonds, we could highlight the need to fill jobs in these expanding industries, motivating people to study these fields, and have access to it nation-wide, fully featured and interactive, and for free.",

    certification:
      "Nationally Certified education, certification and qualification on mobile for free, coupled with free phones, and free internet.",

    benefits:
      "Accelerating education in absence of unemployment, hastening towards a 100% Nation Education and facilitating people remobilising and repurposing in Market Shift, Demand Shift, Business Closure or Job Loss, easier, quicker and more broadly accessible than ever before.",

    expansion:
      "Naturally, this will aid in the expansion of Institutes and Facilities, such as Universities, Schools, etc, so that we have the best Education for free and for all. Where existing institutes, studies, education and learning are not impeded, impaired or made impossible. Instead simple, Nation-Wide access to Mobile-First Online Education across the board.",

    currentImplementation:
      "With regards to just the online education; that could still occur in our current monetary system through non-profits or subsidisation or other ways.",
